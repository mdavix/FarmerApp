## Requirements

## Corn
I'm a farmer and  I need to get my corn across the river to the market. The ferry costs £0.25p per trip and I can only carry one bag across at a time. I need to be able to work out how much it will cost me to move all my stock.

### Requirements
- I need to be able to enter how many bags of corn I have and how much it will cost
- I've heard that web apps are cool and I'd like one of those 
- It needs to work on my smartphone 

## Geese
I've got some geese that I want to sell, I need to get them across the river as well but if I leave them with the corn they will eat it. I need to know the best way of getting all my geese and corn across the river without losing any of it given that I can only take one bag/animal across on the ferry at a time.

### Additional Requirements
- I need to be able to enter how many geese I want to transport across the river
- I should be told whether or not it's possible to move that quantity of geese/corn
- I should be shown a list of crossings that I should use to get all my stock to the market in one piece.

## Foxes
I've heard that people want pet foxes, I've got friendly foxes on my farm who I think would make great pets! unfortunately if I leave them alone with the geese, they will eat them! Please could you extend the app so that it will include foxes when working out a safe way to get my stock to the market?

### Additional Requirements
- I need to be able to enter how many foxes I want to transport across the river
- I should be told whether or not it's possible to move that quantity of geese/corn/foxes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
